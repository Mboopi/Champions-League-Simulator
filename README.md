# Champions League Draw Simulator

### What is this website about?

This site allows you to simulate the UEFA Champions League draw for the season 2022/23.

Check it out: https://ucl-simulator.netlify.app

On the left side, it shows the participating clubs from each pot.
On the right side, you can simulate the draw. You can either draw clubs one by one or perform a full draw.

It currently only supports the draw of the group stage as the season hasn't started yet. Moreover, for clubs of the same association, pairings are made such that the clubs from said pairings will play on different days. As these pairing are not yet known, the simulator does not take these pairings into account.

- Add more animations to make the site more fluid and lively.
- Improve the UI for mobile devices.
- Add options for previous years and KO stages.

### Disclaimer
Note that this site was just made for fun, I do not associate myself with UEFA in any way. Furthermore, I don't take any credits for the wallpaper of the site, which was taken from Google Images. I did apply some upscaling with https://imgupscaler.com/.
